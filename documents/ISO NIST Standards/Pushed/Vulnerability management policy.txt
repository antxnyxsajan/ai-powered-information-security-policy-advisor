purpose

the purpose of this policy is to identify the regulatory requirements for information assets through vulnerability management and to define the measures for notification testing and installation of security patches on devices connected to networks mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities

scope

this policy applies to all employees contractors third parties who access internal information and business processes
responsibilities
isms manager
manage vulnerability and patch management processes
soc analyst
regularly monitor the network and corporate devices for vulnerabilities
monitor the network for vulnerabilities
security engineer
set up the vulnerability management agents on the network equipment
continuously improve the security system
asset manager
set up the vulnerability management agents on the endpoints

policy

vulnerability management workflow
vulnerability scanning
has to conduct routine scans of the company devices and servers connected to the network to identify all types of vulnerabilities biweekly or when any significant change is done
the vulnerability scans are done with a corporate vulnerability scanner for all windows macos and linux systems the corporate vulnerability scanner is linked to siem for further monitoring and comparison also it should compare the results of the current scan with the previous ones
vulnerabilities are regularly reviewed evaluated tested and mitigated
the critical or high vulnerability scan results must be remediated as soon as possible then the next session of scanning will be held to make sure that these vulnerabilities are closed
the medium low or informational vulnerabilities should be remediated at earliest convenience and due risk acceptance model
the dedicated account for vulnerability scans must be used for that activity explicitly
the scan data is sensitive and mustn’t be shared with people who are not involved in these processes
the staff is strictly prohibited from making any temporary changes to the information system to pass an assessment successfully disciplinary procedure will deal with any attempts to tamper with scan results
when the system has vulnerabilities that can not be remediated the risk assessment will be done to identify how these vulnerabilities can be mitigated the corresponding security measures will be implemented
penetration testing
has to conduct penetration testing of the company devices and servers connected to the network to identify all types of vulnerabilities biannually or when any significant change is done
testing should exclude dos ddos and brute force and does not impact the systems’ productivity
penetration testing should be conducted for finding vulnerabilities in the internal network and environments which are segmented for management and external eg website etc
the penetration test data is sensitive and mustn’t be shared with people who are not involved in these processes
remediation measures implementation
the planned remediating actions should be executed in line with the agreed deadlines
if a problem occurs with implemented remediation it should be recorded
alternative actions should be defined by the asset owner based on recommendations these new or other remediating actions should then be implemented
rescanretest
once a vulnerability is remediated a rescanretest has to be scheduled to verify the remediating actions have been implemented
patch management
asset manager maintains overall responsibility for patch management implementation operations and procedures
all resources must be scanned regularly to identify missing updates
all missing software updates must be evaluated according to the risk they pose missing software updates that pose an unacceptable risk to resources must be implemented within a time that is commensurate with the risk
software updates and configuration changes applied to company systems must be tested before widespread implementation and must be implemented under the change management policy
verification of successful software update deployment will be conducted within a reasonable time
