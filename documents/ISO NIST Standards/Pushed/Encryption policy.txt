purpose

the purpose of this policy is to outline the standards for the use of encryption technology so that it is used securely and managed appropriately

scope

this policy covers all data stored on or transmitted across corporate systems

policy

encryption strategy
the following represents the encryption strategy
if disk encryption is used logical access should be managed independently of native operating system access control mechanisms
all information must be encrypted by communication protocols such as httpstls12 or higher when transmitted outside of our company
using only laptops and desktops that have encrypted hard drives
decryption keys should not be tied to user accounts
protect cryptographic keys used for encryption of confidential data against disclosure and misuse
restrict access to cryptographic keys to the fewest number of custodians necessary
store cryptographic keys securely in the fewest possible locations and forms
generate strong cryptographic keys to protect confidential data
secure cryptographic key distribution
secure cryptographic key storage
perform cryptographic key rotation periodically
encryption of data at rest
encryption of data at rest is required to store confidential data such as any data located on companyowned or companyprovided systems devices media etc this includes the following options for stored data
whole disk encryption
encryption of partitionsfiles
encryption of disk drives
encryption of backups
database encryption
encryption key management
the following recommendations apply to the company private ssh keys
management of keys must ensure that data is available for decryption when needed
keys must be backed up
keys must be securely stored
keys must be protected through their whole life cycle against modification loss unauthorized accessuse or disclosure
keys must never be transmitted in cleartext
keys are to be treated as confidential data
keys must not be shared
keys must be used and changed at a minimum annually
