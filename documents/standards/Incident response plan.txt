definitions
incident a security event that has the potential to impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of an organizations assets or operations
incident response ir the steps used to prepare for detect contain and recover from an incident aimed to quickly minimize incident impact contain damage and remediate the cause to reduce the risk of future incidents
incident response plan a documented set of procedures to be followed in the event of a security incident
incident response team a team of professionals responsible for responding to security incidents
incident severity a measure of the impact and urgency of a security incident used to determine the appropriate response actions
containment the process of partial or complete isolation of affected systems users or applications to prevent further damage
remediation the process of minimizing the impact of a security incident by applying precise technical measures
eradication the process of removing malware traces and improving security posture to avoid reinfection or similar incidents
recovery the process of restoring affected systems data operations and workflows to their normal working state
postincident review an analysis of the effectiveness of the incident response effort conducted after the incident has been resolved
postincident activities longterm actions to be implemented after the incident has been resolved aimed to improve overall security posture and increase incident readiness
responsibilities
incident response team
incident response officer is the incident response specialist that has ultimate accountability for the actions of the ir team and ir function this person should be an executivelevel employee
incident response officer is responsible for
reporting to the ceo and is a peer of other clevel executives
an annual summary of the incidents for the calendar year
reviewing any recommendations in the postincident report and determining additional followup actions
leading incident response activities
prevention and resolution of security incidents relating to personal data
procedures of storage processing and auditing personal data
incident response manager is the employee who leads the ir team’s efforts and coordinates activities between all of its respective groups this individual reports to the incident response officer
incident response manager is responsible for
processrelated training material preparation
activating the ir team and managing all parts of the ir process from discovery assessment remediation and resolution
prevention and resolution of security incidents relating to information systems
leading investigations into how breaches happen
soc analyst is a who detects suspicious activity and determines the nature of a threat and the extent of its penetration into the infrastructure this individual reports to the incident response manager
soc analyst is responsible for
monitoring networks and systems for security breaches or intrusions
helping analysts detect incidents
helping plan an organization’s information security strategy
writing correlation rules for monitoring new types of malicious activities
security incident classification system
security incidents will be classified according to incident categories and severity of incidents to determine the appropriate response the incident response officer will maintain a security incident classification scheme to describe security events and support incident tracking over time
four incident severity levels will be used to guide incident response critical high medium and low
incident handling and response plan
detection
soc team is responsible for promptly reporting suspected or known security incidents including an observed or suspected security weakness in systems or services
if there are suspected incidents including breaches of personal identity information in a hierarchical structure individuals at are required to report to if necessary then escalate issues or reports to after that the incident response team must be gathered as quickly as possible communication is via phone email chats or in person also each employee must be notified in the general chat of the company so employees can provide relevant evidence and additional incident information for the incident response team
name response time date host ip other criteria depending on the incident
description of the suspected security incident
why did the incident escalate
analysis and containment
once a potential security incident is reported or anomalous activity detected the analysis must be performed to determine if it is indeed symptomatic of a security incident and to understand the nature of the incident for proper remediation
incident response team can
contact other professionals if needed
analyze and correlate as many indicators as possible such as monitoring network traffic tofrom the host suspected of being compromised network packet captures for more indepth analysis log file analysis interviews with users andor system administrators etc
determine the incident’s scope how many systems are affected is it actively propagating if so how
protect other computers and information on the company network and internet
block malicious ip addresses hosts vlans subnets
if it is critical then disconnect from the entire network
determine if any confidential data was or might have been affected
take action to stop the potential loss of confidential data if needed
changing file permissions to readonly on servers
disconnecting servers with backups from the network
stopping and disabling dbs
changing passwords for administrators
blocking the rights of users not involved in responding to incidents
forced shutdown of workstations using mdm and edr
disconnection of noncritical services from the internet
blocking remote vpn connections
monitoring disk and cpu activity and comparing it with the average
if it became known about the beginning of the spread of the encryptor the incident response manager must immediately provide a centralized command to shutdown endpoints and then block the network
identify the location and owner of the computers so they can be engaged in containment eradication and recovery
research about the specific malware or type of attack also use the internet
perform additional forensics sufficient to characterize the incident
inform clients about incidents if needed clients media and official structures should be notified only with the ceo pr teams approval
eradication and recovery
once an incident is contained all malware should be securely removed systems should again be hardened and patched and updates should be applied affected systems and devices should be restored and returned to the business environment
incident response team must
preserve evidence if it has not already been done
perform additional analysis as needed to complete the investigation
remove the components of the incident impacting the affected systems such as deleting the malicious code or disabling a compromised user account
mitigate the attack vector so a similar incident does not occur for example patch the vulnerability used to compromise the system apply standard system hardening procedures adjust firewall rulesets etc
restore systems to normal operation using backup
restore network access if the system was blocked during the containment phase
return the system to normal operations
answer the following questions
when can systems be returned to production
have systems been patched hardened and tested
can the system be restored from a trusted backup
how long will the affected systems be monitored and what will you look for when monitoring
what tools will ensure similar attacks will not reoccur
postincident activitiesclosure
once the investigation is complete hold an afteraction meeting with all incident response team members and relevant stakeholders if needed to discuss what you’ve learned from the data breach
the following steps should be done
determine lessons learned and make recommendations to prevent subsequent similar incidents
determine ways to improve the management of security incidents and help prevent future incidents
issue final reports
archive evidence and documentation
conduct analysis of incident response process to find weaknesses and answer the following questions
what problems arose during the incident response process what mistakes were made
what changes need to be made to the security
what weakness did the breach exploit
whether to change the content of the incident response plan
whether to conduct urgent training for incident response team and soc analysts
how should employees be trained differently
whether to change or start using new incident detection tools
how will you ensure a similar breach doesn’t happen again
close out the incident
collection and preservation of evidence
when collecting evidence follow all appropriate company policies and procedures
document all actions taken in the collection and preservation of the evidence
for data stored on electronic media make a mirror image or copy depending on applicable requirements of the media
perform all forensics work on the image or copy not the original additional images or copies of the original can be made if needed
incident tracking and reports
the incident response manager will control an incident tracking system and record including but not limited to the following information about all reported security incidents
date of report
submitter name
title

recommendation
insert recommended actions that should be taken to ensure that the same incident does not happen again
all security incidents or suspected incidents ie reports of suspicious activity that upon investigation are determined not to be a security incident will be recorded in the incident tracking system
the incident tracking data is confidential and should be protected when stored or transmitted and disclosed only to authorized individuals
annual report
in each year the incident response officer has to summarize the incidents for the previous calendar year and provide a report to the ceo the security incident data may also be used for other reports as needed this report will be marked as confidential
postincident report
the incident response officer will review any recommendations in the report and determine additional followup actions
postincident reports must be submitted to the incident response officer and be marked as confidential
the postincident report should typically include
description of the incident its id link to the incident record
history of incident record processing including timing and actions by responsible people
impact and loss including financial
if the resolution was effective
conclusions and planned changes to the incident
the postincident report should be attached to the incident records
preparation for the incident
annual training
training must be conducted annually to ensure that all employees have a certain degree of awareness about cybersecurity and a basic level of training in dealing with a cyber crisis everyone also has to be aware of their roles and responsibilities in case of an event
communication guidelines
communication templates and guidelines must be created to enable seamless communication during and after an event with the team and the third party that can be affected by the incident
