definitions
an “it change” is a planned or unplanned action taken to build design modify improve fix and reconfigure network devices and systems
two types of change management requests are to be used emergency and standard an emergency change occurs when an immediate change to systems is necessary due to operational issues or critical security issues a standard change occurs as a part of normal maintenance operations
the change request must be created only for changes that are conducted on or influence on critical assets listed in the critical asset registry
the “change request scope” is each critical information system component subject to change this component must be defined in the critical asset registry or must influence any system components in the critical asset registry
the “impact assessment” is a process to analyze the impact of a proposed organizational change on the company processes
the “rollback plan” is a plan that lets get back to the exact state that was in before the change implementation started
change process
standard change management procedure
what is scope change
develop a request in the mail for testing
identify the authorized party or parties to approve the request
obtain approval or disapproval from the authorized party for investigation and testing
changes shall be tested in an isolated controlled and representative environment where such an environment is possible to minimize the effect on the relevant business process and assess its impact on operations and security
determine the impact of incorporating the change if implementing this change has a big impact low and higher use appendix 12 to define the impact on infrastructure or employees rollback plans must be developed
in the reply to the request for testing develop a change request and attach an implantation change plan and potential impact of incorporating the change how will the change impact the company budget what about the timeline how many departments and team members will be touched by the change request how did the change impact security you need to use appendix 11 as a change request template
71 the individual in charge of the change must provide easytounderstand links or other methods that allow overseeing the process should any issues arise short guidance on where to direct attention and what measures to take in case of any complications following the implementation of the modification
