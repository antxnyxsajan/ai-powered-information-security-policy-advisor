policy

a patch is a software update comprising code inserted ie patched into an executable program code typically a patch is installed into an existing software program patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package patches include but are not limited to the following
updating software
fixing a software bug
installing new drivers
addressing new security vulnerabilities
addressing software stability issues
laptops
every employee’s responsibility is to monitor notifications about new updates available for their os and install them on their laptops
automated updates should be enabled on each employee’s laptop
servers
the patch management is established based on the vulnerability management process described within vulnerability management policy after conducting the vulnerabilitydefining process vulnerability scanning and penetration testing the asset owners must be notified about current vulnerabilities on their assets
asset owners are responsible for timely patching every vulnerability according to instructions from the performer of the vulnerability scanning or penetration testing
any upgrade must be tested before deployment if it is related to critical assets or if it can influence any of the critical assets
the suggested action items for patch management are
keep the inventory of the critical systems including the operating systems and software versions physical location ip addresses etc up to date
assess the vulnerability and risk and classify the risk accordingly find servers and systems which are vulnerable and companycritical
evaluate all missing software updates according to the risk they pose missing software updates that pose an unacceptable risk to the company’s resources must be implemented within a commensurate time with the risk
possible not to apply every patch immediately due to unexpected results within its business operations even though the patch is deemed critical by the vendor patches may be considered to have an adverse impact and disrupt business operations in this case the decision must be justified and documented and all delays regarding patch management must be authorized by the relevant stakeholders
compensating controls must be in place within the company if awareness through media eg online reports vendors etc about vulnerabilities that are identified but do not have an available security patch
compensating controls include but are not limited to
raising awareness about the vulnerability within
turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability
adapting or adding access controls or
increased monitoring to detect or prevent actual attacks
