8.9. POLICY FOR INFORMATION ASSET CLASSIFICATION AND HANDLING
8.9.1. PURPOSE
Information Asset classification, in the context of Information Security, is based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to RSET. Any information asset should not be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorisation. The classification of Information assets helps to determine what baseline Security Controls are appropriate for safeguarding that Information. All Information assets should be classified into one of three sensitivity tiers namely Confidential, Internal, Public.
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that confidential information is protected from unauthorized use and disclosure. This policy helps to facilitate the identification of information assets to support routine disclosure and active dissemination of information. 
8.9.2. SCOPE
This policy applies to all Permanent and Temporary employees of RSET, all contractors, consultants, and vendors who have access to RSET Information asset.
